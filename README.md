Front-end and back-end are deployed separately.

After pulling the repo:

cd front-end<br/>
npm install<br/>
npm start<br/>

And front end will start on localhost:3000

cd back-end<br/>
npm install<br/>
node server.js<br/>

Aaand back end will be running on localhost:2999

Of course mongodb and express should be available for back-end to work.
