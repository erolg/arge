Front-end and back-end are deployed separately.

After pulling the repo:

cd front-end
npm install
npm start

And front end will start on localhost:3000

cd back-end
npm install
node server.js

Aaand back end will be running on localhost:2999

Of course mongodb and express should be available for back-end to work.
